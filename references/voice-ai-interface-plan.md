# Voice AI Interface Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for a voice AI interface using LiveKit for WebRTC audio streaming. The system will:

1. Capture audio from the user's microphone using LiveKit
2. Stream the audio to Deepgram for real-time speech-to-text (STT) processing
3. Send the transcribed text to a language model (LLM) via the Vercel AI SDK
4. Convert the LLM's response to speech using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech (TTS) API
5. Play the synthesized speech back to the user

The implementation will maintain a modular architecture where each component (STT, LLM, TTS) can be swapped out or modified independently.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Audio Capture & WebRTC (LiveKit)

LiveKit will be used to establish a WebRTC connection for capturing and streaming audio from the user's microphone.

**Key Components:**
- `LiveKitRoom`: Container component for establishing a connection to the LiveKit server
- `AudioSession`: Manages audio input/output configurations
- `useTracks`: Hook for accessing audio tracks

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Set up a LiveKit token server for authentication
- Configure audio-only mode (no video)
- Implement proper audio session management for mobile devices

### 2. Speech-to-Text (Deepgram)

Deepgram will be used for real-time transcription of audio streams via WebSocket.

**Key Components:**
- WebSocket connection to Deepgram API
- Audio data formatting and streaming
- Transcription result handling

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Establish a secure WebSocket connection with authentication
- Convert LiveKit audio data to the format expected by Deepgram
- Handle streaming transcription results and partial results
- Implement error handling and reconnection logic

### 3. Language Model Integration (Vercel AI SDK)

The Vercel AI SDK will be used to communicate with the language model.

**Key Components:**
- `useChat` hook for managing conversation state
- API route for handling LLM requests
- Message formatting and streaming

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Configure the Vercel AI SDK for React Native
- Set up an API endpoint for the LLM
- Handle streaming responses from the LLM
- Manage conversation context and history

### 4. Text-to-Speech (ElevenLabs)

ElevenLabs will be used to convert text responses from the LLM to natural-sounding speech.

**Key Components:**
- ElevenLabs React SDK (`@11labs/react`)
- `useConversation` hook for managing the TTS session
- Audio playback management

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement the ElevenLabs SDK
- Configure voice settings and preferences
- Handle streaming audio playback
- Implement error handling for TTS failures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Audio Capture

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @livekit/react-native @livekit/react-native-webrtc @11labs/react react-native-vercel-ai
   ```

2. Create a new tab for the Voice AI interface
3. Implement basic LiveKit audio capture
4. Test microphone access and audio session management

### Phase 2: Deepgram Integration

1. Create a WebSocket client for Deepgram
2. Implement audio streaming from LiveKit to Deepgram
3. Handle and display transcription results
4. Test real-time transcription accuracy and latency

### Phase 3: LLM Integration with Vercel AI SDK

1. Configure the Vercel AI SDK for React Native
2. Create an API endpoint for the LLM
3. Implement conversation state management
4. Test text-based conversation flow

### Phase 4: ElevenLabs Integration

1. Implement the ElevenLabs React SDK
2. Configure voice settings
3. Implement audio playback of TTS responses
4. Test voice quality and latency

### Phase 5: End-to-End Integration

1. Connect all components in a seamless flow
2. Implement proper state management for the conversation
3. Add UI indicators for listening, thinking, and speaking states
4. Implement error handling and recovery for each component
5. Test the complete voice conversation experience

## Technical Considerations

### Audio Format and Sampling

- Ensure audio is captured at the correct sample rate for Deepgram (typically 16kHz)
- Configure proper audio encoding (PCM 16-bit)
- Handle potential audio format conversion if needed

### Latency Management

- Implement streaming for all components to minimize end-to-end latency
- Consider buffering strategies for audio playback
- Optimize WebSocket connections for real-time performance

### Mobile-Specific Considerations

- Handle audio session interruptions (phone calls, other apps)
- Implement proper background mode handling
- Manage battery usage for continuous audio processing

### Security

- Secure API keys for all services
- Implement proper token authentication for LiveKit
- Consider user privacy and data handling

## UI/UX Design

The voice interface should include:

1. A clear visual indicator of the current state:
   - Listening (microphone active)
   - Processing (transcribing and generating response)
   - Speaking (playing TTS response)

2. Text display showing:
   - Real-time transcription of user speech
   - LLM response text

3. Controls for:
   - Starting/stopping the conversation
   - Muting the microphone
   - Adjusting volume
   - Canceling the current response

## Dependencies

- **LiveKit**: `@livekit/react-native`, `@livekit/react-native-webrtc`
- **Deepgram**: Custom WebSocket implementation
- **Vercel AI SDK**: `react-native-vercel-ai`, `ai`
- **ElevenLabs**: `@11labs/react`
- **React Native Audio**: Native audio session management

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with all required dependencies
2. Create a basic proof-of-concept for each component individually
3. Begin implementation of the Voice AI tab following the phased approach
4. Conduct regular testing to ensure each component works as expected
5. Refine the UI/UX based on testing feedback

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for creating a modular, efficient voice AI interface using LiveKit, Deepgram, Vercel AI SDK, and ElevenLabs. The modular architecture ensures that components can be replaced or upgraded independently as needed.
